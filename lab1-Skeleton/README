Added 2 more test cases to both test-t-bad.sh and test-t-ok.sh.

Also added 2 new test scripts for the execution aspect of the lab: 

test-exec.sh, which tests whether or not the execution portion of the code works when the command is formatted correctly an the commands are used properly, which it should.

test-exec-bad.sh, which tests whether or not the execution works with nonexistent
commands or commands with incorrect usage that are formatted correctly, which it should not.

Code compiles on c99 and c11
We do not account for the case where there is a \n after a pipe: a | \n b

For our program, if we see an exec command, then we run the command that
follows, by basically changing the arguments that execvp receives. The exec
command will more than likely not work if the command is something like 
exec 3< readfile. The exec command WILL work if the command is something like
exec echo testing, since in that case, we just need send "echo testing" to
execvp, instead of "exec echo testing"
